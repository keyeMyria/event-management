## Setup and Requirements

- If you donâ€™t already have a Google Account (Gmail or Google Apps), you must [create one](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp). Then, sign-in to Google Cloud Platform console ([console.cloud.google.com](http://console.cloud.google.com/)) and create a new project:


- Store your project ID into a variable as many commands below use it:

    ```
    export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    ```

- Next, [enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) in the Cloud Console in order to use Google Cloud resources and [enable the Container Engine API](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/kubernetes/list).

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), and [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

- Finally, after Google Cloud SDK installs, run the following command to install `kubectl`:

    ```
    gcloud components install kubectl
    ```

- Choose a [Google Cloud Project zone](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones) to run your service. We will be using us-central1-a. This is configured on the command line via:

    ```
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-a
    ```

## Create and format a persistent data disk for postgres

- Create a persistent disk. (min. 1 GB) with a name `pg-data-disk`.

    ```
    gcloud compute disks create pg-data-disk --size 1GB
    ```

- The disk created is un formatted and needs to be formatted. To do that, we need to create a temporarily compute instance.

    ```
    gcloud compute instances create pg-disk-formatter
    ```

- Wait for the instance to get created. Once done, attach the disk to that instance.

    ```
    gcloud compute instances attach-disk pg-disk-formatter --disk pg-data-disk
    ```

- SSH into the instance.

    ```
    gcloud compute ssh "pg-disk-formatter"
    ```

- In the terminal, use the `ls` command to list the disks that are attached to your instance and find the disk that you want to format and mount

    ```
    ls /dev/disk/by-id
    ```
    
    ```
    google-example-instance       scsi-0Google_PersistentDisk_example-instance
    google-example-instance-part1 scsi-0Google_PersistentDisk_example-instance-part1
    google-[DISK_NAME]            scsi-0Google_PersistentDisk_[DISK_NAME]
    ```

    where `[DISK_NAME]` is the name of the persistent disk that you attached to the instance.
    
    The disk ID usually includes the name of your persistent disk with a `google-` prefix or a `scsi-0Google_PersistentDisk_` prefix. You can use either ID to specify your disk, but this example uses the ID with the `google-` prefix


- Format the disk with a single `ext4` filesystem using the `mkfs` tool. This command deletes all data from the specified disk.

    ```
    sudo mkfs.ext4 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/disk/by-id/google-[DISK_NAME]
    ```

- Now, the disk is formatted and ready. Detach the disk from the instance.

    ```
    gcloud compute instances detach-disk pg-disk-formatter --disk pg-data-disk
    ```

_You can delete the instance if your not planning to use it for anything else. But make sure the disk `pg-data-disk` is not deleted._

Repeat the same procedure and create another disk named `nfs-data-disk`.

## Create your Kubernetes Cluster

- Create a cluster via the `gcloud` command line tool:

    ```
    gcloud container clusters create opev-cluster --image-type=container_vm
    ```

- Get the credentials for `kubectl` to use.

    ```
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials opev-cluster
    ```

## Deploy our pods, services and deployments

- From the project directory, use the provided deploy script to deploy our application from the defined configuration files that are in the `kubernetes` directory.

    ```
    ./kubernetes/deploy.sh
    ```

- The Kubernetes master creates the load balancer and related Compute Engine forwarding rules, target pools, and firewall rules to make the service fully accessible from outside of Google Cloud Platform.
    
    To find the ip addresses associated with the service run:

    ```
    kubectl get services web
    ```

    The `EXTERNAL_IP` may take several minutes to become available and visible. If the `EXTERNAL_IP` is missing, wait a few minutes and try again.
    
    Note there are 2 IP addresses listed, both serving port 80. `CLUSTER_IP` is only visible inside your cloud virtual network. `EXTERNAL_IP` is externally accessible.
    
    You should now be able to reach the web application by pointing your browser to this address: `http://EXTERNAL_IP`

## Other handy commands

- Delete all created pods, services and deployments

    ```
    kubectl delete -R -f kubernetes/yamls/
    ```
    
-  Access The Kubernetes dashboard Web GUI

    Run the following command to start a proxy.
    
    ```
    kubectl proxy
    ```
    
    and Goto [http://localhost:8001/ui](http://localhost:8001/ui)

- Deleting the cluster
    ```
    gcloud container clusters delete opev-cluster
    ```
